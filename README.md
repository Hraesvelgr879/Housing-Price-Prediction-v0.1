# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts house prices using various regression techniques. This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflows including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project uses synthetic housing data to predict prices based on features like:
- Location and neighborhood characteristics
- House specifications (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- Property features (age, lot size, amenities)
- Local factors (crime rate, school ratings, distance to city)

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Generation**: Creates realistic synthetic housing dataset
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical analysis and visualizations
- **Data Preprocessing**: Feature engineering, encoding, and scaling
- **Multiple ML Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics, residual analysis, feature importance
- **Visualizations**: Interactive plots and comprehensive analysis charts

## 📊 Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline model
2. **Ridge Regression** - L2 regularization
3. **Lasso Regression** - L1 regularization  
4. **Random Forest** - Ensemble method
5. **Gradient Boosting** - Advanced ensemble
6. **Support Vector Regression** - Non-linear relationships
